Overview

The Lost & Found web application is designed to help people quickly reconnect with their lost belongings or report items they have found. Users can register, log in, create listings for lost or found items, browse existing items, and contact the owners. The platform focuses on user-friendliness, fast access, and secure management of items, leveraging the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
